                Hello! To use this page please login / sign up first! Afterwards you can create your own farm and learn about different villagers, buildings, etc. from Stardew Valley.
                Future updates will (hopefully ;) )include:
                <br></br>
                - More info about game components!
                <br></br>
                - Ability to track villager hearts and get notified when you have a heart event ready!
                <br></br>
                - Ability to choose between Stardew Valley info and Stardew Valley Expanded info! (Yay for mods!)
                <br></br>
                - Ability to make and track more than one farm (that way if you're like me and have 1234802938012billion games going at once you can track all of them!)
                <br></br>
                -Pictures for game components and background changes
